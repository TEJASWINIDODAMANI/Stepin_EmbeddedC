# Simulation

The heat control system is implemented in Embedded C program and the working is demonstrated using SimulIDE software.


## Problem statement

## Functionality
* When the two buttons (switches) are closed, the LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater.
* Next the analog input from the temperature sensor is received and digitized.
* The digitized temperature input is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation.
